### Project Overview

* The goal of this application was to create a simple calendar tool that could be used to schedule the hours of a normal work day.  

* The Schedule.ME application is able to display the current time and color codes each time block by the past, present, or future.  

* The user of this application is able to select a timeblock and input whatever they would like to schedule into each time block hour.  

* The input can then be saved to the schedule by clicking the 'Clipboard' and cleared out by clicking the 'Clear' button.

* The user's events will be saved even upon refreshing.
